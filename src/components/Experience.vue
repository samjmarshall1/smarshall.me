        <div class="subheading mb-3"> </div>
        <p>Alongside my professional experience I have spent my School and University years in summer jobs which helped me develop all of my soft skills and work ethic. I spent 2 years working at Plumbing World, A merchant for Plumbing products. It was my first introduction to building positive relationships with customers, Taking responsibility in collecting orders and delivering to job sites and assisting all staff members. Another couple of years were spent working in a Cherry Orchard which involved me supervising fruit pickers. These years improved my communication skills due to a high percentage of pickers not speaking English as their first language and also I had the responsibility of recording the amount of buckets picked which can prove to be an issue if there is a disparity between my number and what they think they have done. Both jobs provided their fair share of hard manual labour which defiantly taught me the value of a hard days work.  </p>

            <h3 class="mb-0"> Performance Testing Related Experience</h3>
            <div class="subheading mb-3"> </div>
            <p>During the duration of my career as a Performance Test Engineer I have learnt quickly the
                  value of not becoming a “script monkey” and be willing to question the results of a test
                  and always look to dive deeper and try and discover the cause of an issue. Despite my
                  lack of years in this industry I have been working alongside experienced Performance
                  Testers and have used this to my advantage to up skill in all aspects of the practice. I
                  spent a lot of time learning how to extract and wrangle data using Perl/Groovy and then plotting
                  this data using R to create automatic Performance Test Reports, which we can use to
                  present our load results and system monitoring stats to the client. I have been faced with scripting rather complex systems
                  with very awkward and unusual architecture, and worked alongside architects to solve
                  issues that were discovered during testing. I also have experience in writing Performance test strategy documents and
                  final test exit reports.</p>
