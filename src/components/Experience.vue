          <p>While working for a software testing consultancy, I have been working in the practice of performance

         testing. This has involved working on multiple projects in a

      Government organisation with complex enterprise insurance systems. I have also gained

experience in functional testing engagements and have been introduced to test automation.

          <p>Warm Fuzzies is a start up company looking to tackle a big problem in New Zealand - unhealthy homes.
            Working in a startup company and working towards a meaningful goal was a great experience and helped me develop new ways of working and thinking.
            My role included doing administration, human resources, information systems, client relations and house assessments.
             During my time here I greatly improved my organisational and time management skills by
             having to manage employees and clients to schedule appointments for house inspections.</p>

        <div class="subheading mb-3"> </div>
        <p>Alongside my professional experience I have spent my school and university years in summer jobs which helped me develop all of my soft skills and work ethic.
           I spent two years working at Plumbing World, a merchant for plumbing products.
           This was my first introduction to building positive relationships with customers, taking responsibility in collecting orders, delivering to job sites and assisting all staff members. Another couple of years were spent working in a cherry orchard which involved me supervising fruit pickers. These years improved my communication skills because a high percentage of pickers did not speak english as their first language. I also had the responsibility of recording the amount of buckets picked which can prove to be an issue if there is a disparity between my number and what they think they have done. Both jobs provided their fair share of hard manual labour which definitely taught me the value of a hard days work.  </p>

            <h3 class="mb-0"> Performance Testing Related Experience</h3>
            <div class="subheading mb-3"> </div>
            <p>Throughout the duration of my career as a performance test engineer, I have learnt quickly the
                  value of not becoming a “script monkey”, to be willing to question the results of a test
                  and always dive deeper to try and discover the cause of an issue. Despite my
                  lack of years in this industry, I have been working alongside experienced performance
                  testers and have used this to my advantage to up-skill in all aspects of the practice. I have
                  spent a lot of time learning how to extract and wrangle data using Perl/Groovy and then plotting
                  this data using R to create automatic Performance Test Reports, which we can use to
                  present our load test results and system monitoring stats to the client. I have been faced with scripting rather complex systems
                  with very awkward and unusual architecture and have also worked alongside architects to solve
                  issues that were discovered during testing. In addition, I have experience in writing performance test strategy documents and
                  final test exit reports.</p>
