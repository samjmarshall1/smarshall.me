            <div class="subheading mb-3"> </div>
            <p>During the duration of my career as a Performance Test Engineer I have learnt quickly the
                  value of not becoming a “script monkey” and be willing to question the results of a test
                  and always look to dive deeper and try and discover the cause of an issue. Despite my
                  lack of years in this industry I have been working alongside experienced Performance
                  Testers and have used this to my advantage to up skill in all aspects of the practice. I
                  spent a lot of time learning how to extract and wrangle data using Perl/Groovy and then plotting
                  this data using R to create automatic Performance Test Reports, which we can use to
                  present our load results and system monitoring stats to the client. I have been faced with scripting rather complex systems
                  with very awkward and unusual architecture, and worked alongside architects to solve
                  issues that were discovered during testing. I also have experience in writing Performance test strategy documents and
                  final test exit reports.</p>
