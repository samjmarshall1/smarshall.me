      <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>
      <p>Apart from being a performance tester, I am sports mad! I love to play basketball, football, tennis and volleyball. I go to the gym regularly and have also recently starting running. I completed my first half marathon last November and have another one in October this year. I also love movies and music from all eras and genres.  </p>
      <p class="mb-5">I enjoy keeping up to date on Twitter, Reddit, blogs and podcasts to keep abreast of new trends, global happenings and areas of interest to me. I have a real love for following sport, especially with the consent developments in sport data analytics and technologies. There is never a dull moment in the sports world.</p>
