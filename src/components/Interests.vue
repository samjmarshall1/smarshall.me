      <p>Apart from being a performance tester, I am sports mad! I love to play basketball, football, tennis and volleyball. I go to the gym regularly and also recently starting running, completing my first half marathon last November and I have another one in October this year. I also love movies and music from all eras and genres.  </p>
      <p class="mb-5">I like to stay up to date with current tech. I love keep up to date on Twitter, Reddit,blogs and podcasts to keep abreast of new trends, global happenings and areas of interest to me.  I have a real love for following sport. Especially with the consent developments in sport data analytics and technology there is never a dull moment in the sports world.</p>
